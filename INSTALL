$PROJECTNAME$ - install HOWTO

	$PROJECTNAME$ build system is using bjam (Boost library's build tool)




Setting up the build process

	* Getting all external libraries
	
		You have the choice between:
		1) install libraries on your system using standard packages
		- OR - 
		2) download and compile all these libraries by yourself
			In this case, you need to edit the project-config.jam script

		See externals/README file for the full list of dependencies 
		
	* Building the building tool (the build-ception...)
	
		BJam is Boost library's build tool.
		Donwload and uncompress a full boost package in the externals directory.
		Open a terminal and go to the boost root folder. Then type:
		
		1) under linux/osx platform:
			./bootstrap
			./bjam
		- OR -
		2) under windows platform:
			bootstrap.bat
			bjam.exe
		
	* Setting up environment variables
	
		In order to use bjam and build $PROJECTNAME$, two environment variables have to be set:
			BOOST_ROOT			- to locate boost root directory
			BOOST_BUILD_PATH	- to locate boost.build scripts

		1) under linux/osx platform (edit the first line):
			export BOOST_ROOT=/your/path/to/boost/root/directory
			export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=$BOOST_ROOT/tools/build/v2
		- OR -
		2) under windows platform (edit the first line):
			set BOOST_ROOT=C:\your\path\to\boost\root\directory
			set BOOST_BUILD_PATH=%BOOST_ROOT%\tools\build\v2
			

Building

	* Choose the appropriate script depending on your platform
		./build-osx-darwin.sh on MacOSX
		./build-linux-gcc.sh on Linux
		./build-windows-mingw.bat on Windows with the mingw package

	* Run it with one or more of the following command line arguments
		dist 				: Full build & installation 
		tests				: Build & run unit test suite
		debug -or- release 	: Select the build variant
		--help 				: Display help message
		--clean 			: Remove targets instead of building
